## Implementation process :

- Data Acquisition: Receive data from the recruitment process, including information about the selected candidates and the necessary content to create the offer letters.

- Generating Offer Letters: Using pre-defined templates or provided information, the robot will generate the offer letters according to the required format and content.

- Data Processing: Validate and process candidate data, including entering personal information, job details, and any additional required information.

- Sending the Offer Letters: Automatically send the generated offer letters to the email addresses of the selected candidates. This process may utilize email protocols through email servers or external email services.

- Logging and Notifications: Log the sent offer letters and notify HR personnel about the status of the invitation letters (completed, failed, etc.).
